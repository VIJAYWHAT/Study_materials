API - Application Programming Interface 

It's a Intermediary Software

- An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other.

- An API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another. It also contains the terms of this data exchange.
 
- APIs are a set of functions and procedures that allow for the creation of applications.

- Mobile app  to access data from a DB
- Website to access a 3rd party service

- API used in Web development,mobile app development and Data analysis


How do APIs work?
	- The working principle of APIs is commonly expressed through the request-response communication between a client and a server. The client is any front-end application that a user interacts with. The server is in charge of backend logic and database operations. In this scenario, an API works as a middle layer between the client and the server, making it possible to send data requests and responses.

The main types of APIs are :-

- Public or Open API
- Private or Internal API
- partner API
- Composite API

Open API: Publicly accessible APIs with no restrictions. 

Partner API: These types of API is not open to the public, Restricted APIs for business partners and clients.access is restricted through the use of specific licenses.

Private API: Internal APIs used within a single company. 

Composite API: Combine data and services to streamline tasks.

API Types by use cases 

Database APIs --> Database APIs enable communication between an application and a database management system.

Operating systems APIs --> how applications use the resources and services of operating systems.

Remote APIs --> Remote APIs define standards of interaction for applications running on different machines.

Web APIs --> Web APIs provide machine-readable data and functionality transfer between web-based systems which represent client-server architecture

It's different from WebApp 
===================================================================
Web App                | Web API
=======================|===========================================
- It's a website       |- It's Service 
- UI and Data in HTML  |- JSON Or XML
- Complete Application |- Data Flow 
- Call API as service  |- It's does not call WebApp
- Rendered in Browser  |- It can be used in mobile app,
		       | backend in javascript framework web app,
		       | can be part of webapp
